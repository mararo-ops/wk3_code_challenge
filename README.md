Restaurant Review Management System
Overview
This README file outlines the deliverables for the Restaurant Review Management System project. The project involves managing reviews for restaurants, customers, and their relationships using SQLAlchemy. Three main classes are involved: Restaurant, Customer, and Review, each with specific methods and relationships.

Getting Started
Before you begin working on the project deliverables, make sure you have set up your environment and created the necessary tables using SQLAlchemy. Ensure that you have executed the migration to create the required database tables.

Prerequisites
Python (3.7+)
SQLAlchemy
SQLite (or any other database of your choice)
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip:
Run the migration to create the database tables:
Use the seeds.py file to populate the database with initial data for testing:
Now that you have set up the project, you can proceed with implementing the deliverables.

Migrations
Before working on other deliverables, you need to create a migration for all tables. The reviews table should have the following columns:

id (primary key)
restaurant_id (foreign key to Restaurant)
customer_id (foreign key to Customer)
star_rating (integer)
Ensure that the relationships between Review, Restaurant, and Customer are properly established in the migration.

Object Relationship Methods
Review
Review.customer(): Returns the Customer instance for this review.
Review.restaurant(): Returns the Restaurant instance for this review.
Restaurant
Restaurant.reviews(): Returns a collection of all the reviews for the Restaurant.
Restaurant.customers(): Returns a collection of all the customers who reviewed the Restaurant.
Customer
Customer.reviews(): Returns a collection of all the reviews that the Customer has left.
Customer.restaurants(): Returns a collection of all the restaurants that the Customer has reviewed.
Ensure that these methods work as expected by querying the database using SQLAlchemy. For example, session.query(Customer).first().restaurants should return a list of restaurants for the first customer in the database based on the seed data.

Aggregate and Relationship Methods
Customer
Customer.full_name(): Returns the full name of the customer, with the first name and the last name concatenated in Western style.
Customer.favorite_restaurant(): Returns the restaurant instance that has the highest star rating from this customer.
Customer.add_review(restaurant, rating): Creates a new review for the restaurant with the given restaurant_id and rating.
Customer.delete_reviews(restaurant): Removes all reviews by the customer for a specific restaurant.
Review
Review full_review(): Returns a string formatted as follows: Review for {restaurant name} by {insert customer's full name}: {insert review star_rating} stars.
Restaurant
Restaurant fanciest(), this method should be a class method: Returns one restaurant instance for the restaurant that has the highest price.
Restaurant all_reviews(): Returns a list of strings with all the reviews for this restaurant
